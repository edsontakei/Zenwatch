The goal of this project is to build a stress monitoring system to assist in the monitoring of stress levels. According to the New York State Office of Mental Health, stress reactions are multiple and can be behavioural, psychological, physical, cognitive and social. To build a device that can yield quantifiable data, we have
opted for analyzing physical stress reactions to properly quantify stress levels. Taking into account the low-cost requirement of the device as well as its replicability, usability and non-invasiveness requirements, we have opted to analyse changes in heart rate and sweat out of the parameters listed by the New York State of Mental ealth as parameters indicative of stress [Fig. 1]. We believe that those parameters
can be good indicators of stress and assist individuals in becoming aware of their stress levels
